# My Personal Website

Alright cool so I guess in markdown I can just type text here. Gangster.

Oh man, you don't have to set the ruler or return to indent your paragraphs, that's going to mess with me. And all the text I compose is aligned directly left here in VS Code. Gross. Ew, and the word wrap works like notepad. Ah, geez.

## Ah that's right this is a readme file 

### Welcome to the Readme for My Personal Website

My Personal Website is a website I was asked to make to complete the prework for my enrollment in the **Flatiron Full Stack Software Engineer** program, oh good, my word processor 'bold' hotkey doesn't work in code. Alright, worked that out. 

My plan is to use this website to introduce myself to my colleagues and to show off a few of the tricks I've picked up while I've been learning to code. Aesthetics will also be considered. 

## Usage

I would prefer you only use this website to draw *positive* opinions of me. Of course I welcome solution oriented critique, so that would be a great way to use this website.

Let's say CC0; that's always legally confusing. Hey! That means you can use that "legally confusing" line any time you want, and I have to grit my teeth and acknowledge your right to do so.
